            <p>Refine that idea into a solid basis for an application.
               Make sure our initial analysis includes actual demographics, motivations, behavior patterns and goals of your persona.
              During each stage of the process, keep the end user in mind.
              , trying to think of your customer‚Äôs lifecycle, once their characteristics are pinned down.
               After you reach them, they are acquired, converted, retained and their loyalty nurtured.
                By the end, we should understand how the customer will be using the digital product.
                 Doing this at the very onset will set us on firm footing, and our clarity will give you and your investors, much-needed confidence.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-4">Design and Develop</h4>
          <p>As the development progresses, 
            the app goes through a set of stages. 
            In the initial stage, the core functionality although present is not tested.
             See the app is very buggy, and non-core functionality doesn‚Äôt exist at this point.
              In the second stage, much of the functionality proposed is incorporated.
               The app has ideally gone through light testing and bug fixing,
                though some issues could still be present. In this phase,
                 the app is released to a certain group of external users for more testing.
                  After the bugs in the second stage are fixed, the app will move to the deployment phase where it‚Äôs ready for release.
                  If yours is a complex project where user requirements change regularly, we make use of agile methodology.
                   It helps with flexible planning, progressive development,
                    early deployment and constant improvements. A large application can be broken down into smaller modules,
                     and agile methodology can be applied to each of these small parts.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-4">Test & Deliver</h4>
          <p>We test early and often. Doing this will keep your final costs low.
             The farther in we go into the development cycle, the costlier it becomes to fix bugs.
              Refer to the original design and planning documents while building out the various test cases.
              we cover all the necessary facets of it.
               The application will be tested for usability,
                compatibility, security, 
                interface checks, stress, and performance.
                Your app is ready to submit.
                 Choose a day and key up a formal launch. 
                 For different application stores, the policies of launching an application are different.
                  And keep in mind, this is not the end. App development doesn‚Äôt end at launch. As your application gets in the hands of users,
                   feedback will pour in, and you will need to incorporate that feedback into future versions of the app.
